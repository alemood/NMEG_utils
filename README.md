# NMEG_utils

A collection of Python and R code to read, transform, and plot NMEG data. Also contains a number of scripts for extracting NMEG and ancillary data from standard files and creating derivative data files.

**WARNING**: Many of these are quite rough and not well commented. This will improve, but for now you should probably ignore docstrings and other comments/boilerplate in the files.
